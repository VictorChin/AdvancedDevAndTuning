<h2>How to diagnose and avoid subverting the benefit<br>
  of the PL/SQL cursor cache</h2>


Let your application run and observe
<tt>open_cursor_sql_text</tt>
as above. (In the real world you may need to restrict on
<tt>v$open_cursor.sid</tt>

to focus on a single session.) A
<tt>SELECT COUNT()...GROUP BY</tt>
query thus...
  <pre class="Code_Emphasize">select count(sql_text) c, sql_text
  from open_cursor_sql_text
  group by sql_text

  order by c desc, sql_text
</pre>
  ...helps, since we're looking for multiple occurrences of the same SQL statement.
<p>
<b><font color=red>If ever you find a SQL statement with two ore more occurences, then investigate!</font></b>
<p>
The likely explanation is that you missed an opportunity to write some re-usable code.

The solution will usually be to encapsulate a cursor for the offending SQL statement
within a procedure or function, and then to replace your
previous constructs that used this SQL statement with an invocation
of the new procedure or function,
for example...
  <pre><span class="Code_Emphasize">procedure P is
  g_last_name employees.last_name%type;
  procedure Get_Last_Name is

  begin
    select last_name into g_last_name from employees where employee_id = 100;
  end Get_Last_Name;
begin
  Get_Last_Name;</span>
  <span class="Code_Comment">--
  -- time elapses, last_name may have changed for this employee
  --</span>
<span class="Code_Emphasize">  Get_Last_Name;

end P;</span>
</pre>
  This re-write not only yields code with
better readablility and maintaiability, but also better performance!
<p>
There may be some special cases where you have to decide that multiple cursors
for the same statement are unavoidable
(for example if the SQL statement invokes a function
which in turn executes the same SQL statement),
but in the majority of cases finding mutilple

occurrences of the same SQL statement in
<tt>v$open_cursor</tt>
means you have an opportunity to improve your performance.
